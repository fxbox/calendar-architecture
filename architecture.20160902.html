## Introduction

Voice Reminders is an app to manage reminders using mainly a voice interface.

Main features are:
* Create reminders for oneself or other members of groups
* Have an overview of the existing reminder always-on
* Receive notifications on personal phones

---

## Bird-eye overview

The application is split in 2 parts:
* [the back-end part](https://github.com/fxbox/calendar) exposes a REST API to do all manipulations. It uses CORS to
allow access from any page.
* [the front-end](https://github.com/fxbox/calendar-server) is using this REST API to propose a consistent UX.

# Some words about the frontend

---
## The frontend

The frontend is using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as its rendering library.

At the first launch the user enters a login form. He can enter an email and a
password.

If the credentials are correct the server returns a JSON Web Token containing
the session informations. This Web Token is stored in localStorage.

Next time the user connects the JWT is reused and the main view is rendered.

---
## A service worker

The frontend installs a service worker to support offline and push
notifications.

We use the standard push notifications API. The data we get from the API are
sent to the server where it's persisted to be used when it's needed.

Push Notifications are used to remind the user about a ... reminder. :)

---
## Voice control

There is a 2-step process:

1. using a [Javascript build of pocketsphinx](http://syl22-00.github.io/pocketsphinx.js/) we locally listen for a wake word.
2. when a wakeword is recognized, or when the user taps a button, we use
Chrome's integrated Speech Recognition capability to conduct a speech to text
conversion.

We also use Chrome's Web Speech API to _speak_ text.

This means some data actually goes out to Google's servers. We plan to replace
some of this by other 3rd-party servers like Nuance.

This also means this works in Chrome only.

# Deep dive into the server-side

---
## Technologies

We use these basic blocks:
* NodeJS v6
* [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) with JWT and CORS plugins, + the body-parser JSON and urlencoded decoder
* SQLite v3 with the node-sqlite3 client

---
## Overview

The server-side is split in 3 main parts, 1 of them in a separate process.

Process 1:
* the main ExpressJS-based app
* a cron-like that regularly checks whether a notification is due.

Process 2:
* Sends the notification through the push notification server.

# The ExpressJS-based app

---
## Organization of the code

* `dao`: contains database access code
* `routes`: contains the HTTP routes and some simple business logic
* `utils`: various utils we need in some places
* `config`: contains a config template that you should copy, this is
  read and handled by config.js; there are usually sensible
  default values except for Google's key
* `business`: higher complexity code; basically, our implicit
  rule with Johan is that once the code in a route started to
  be too complex, we moved it here.

---
## API

The API is described in the [application's README
file](https://github.com/fxbox/calendar-server/blob/master/README.md).

[The API is being reworked](https://github.com/fxbox/calendar-server/pull/44/files) to permit more complex use cases.
This is the API that is being described in this slidedeck.

---
## User registration

POSTing to /users creates a new user. We pass email, password, forename and we
return a user object with an id. The password is never returned (even in an
hashed form).

The password is hashed using Argon2 and stored in sqlite.

In the future we want a 2-step user creation process where the user has to
confirm the subscription, to prevent spam.

---
## Login process

Email and passwords are sent as a JSON object. If authentication is successful
we return a JSON Web Token. The JWT secret is configurable.

Every API besides user registration and login needs this JWT to accept requests,
passed in an `Authorization` header.

---
## Finding due notifications

This is done using Node's `setInterval` mechanism. So it runs in the same event
loop as the main ExpressJS app. It would be really easy to split it to its own
process though.

It sets up a [0mq](http://zeromq.org/) socket where notification requests are
pushed.

---
## Sending notifications

This is done in process 2. This process listens on the 0mq socket and reacts to
new messages. It uses the stored information about push messages subscription to
send a push message through the push server.

---
## Deployment

The server is deployed on an AWS VM. We use pm2 to manage the application
lifecycle.
